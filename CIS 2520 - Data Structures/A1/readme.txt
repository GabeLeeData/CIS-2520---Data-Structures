***Compiling***

To compile the program simply type "make" within the appropriate directory where all the files are located within the terminal.
After the program is compiled type in "./a1" to run the Program in the terminal.


***Introductory***

When launching the program the user will be prompted with a menu displaying the 3 different
C programs that were needed for the assignment. By typing the number associated with each
different program listed on the menu will execute the program such as for the Carbon program
the user will have to type in "1" on the terminal. To exit the program the user simply needs to
type "4" on the menu screen.


***Sample Output***

~~Carbon Program~~

carbon
carbno
carobn
caronb
carnbo
carnob
cabron
cabrno

This is just the first 8 entries, there are 720 possible combinations that will be displayed
on the terminal.


~~Ackermann Program~~

A(0, 0) = 1
A(0, 1) = 2
A(0, 2) = 3
A(0, 3) = 4
A(0, 4) = 5
A(1, 0) = 2
A(1, 1) = 3
A(1, 2) = 4
A(1, 3) = 5
A(2, 0) = 3
A(2, 1) = 5
A(2, 2) = 7
A(3, 0) = 5
A(3, 1) = 13
A(4, 0) = 13

Is the output that will be displayed when the user types in 4 for the First number and
5 for the Second number. It was examined that anything greater than 4,6 that is entered within
the program, it cannot exceed the values. If the user enters 4,6 the program prompts:

A(0, 0) = 1
A(0, 1) = 2
A(0, 2) = 3
A(0, 3) = 4
A(0, 4) = 5
A(0, 5) = 6
A(1, 0) = 2
A(1, 1) = 3
A(1, 2) = 4
A(1, 3) = 5
A(1, 4) = 6
A(2, 0) = 3
A(2, 1) = 5
A(2, 2) = 7
A(2, 3) = 9
A(3, 0) = 5
A(3, 1) = 13
A(3, 2) = 29
A(4, 0) = 13
A(4, 1) = 65533

This is the maximum range of values the terminal will show in regards to this program.
After A(4,0) = 13 the only values that will be shown are 65533.



~~Newton Program~~


Enter a number that will calculate the Square Root using Newtons Method: 25
Please Enter the Value for the Accuracy:  0.001

With the Non-Recursion Method Square Root of 25 with a accuracy of 1.000000e-03 is:
  5.008271e+00

With the Recursion Method the Square Root of 25 with a accuracy of 1.000000e-03 is:
  5.008271e+00


Simply just enter a number that you want to Square root using Newtons method
and the following accuracy for inputs.
